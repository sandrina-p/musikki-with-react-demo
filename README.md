# musikki-api with React

This is my first project with React. It is a simple APP with a Login/Register and a Dashboard where you can dynamically search artists and save them as Favorite.

**Features:**
- static Login / Register (saved on Local Storage)
- Search Artists (with an Musikki-API)
- Save Artists searched as Favorite
- Favorites Artists keep saved when you switch between multiple accounts or refresh the page (LocalStorage)
- The url hash (#/) updates on your navigation and allows "back history" thanks to React Routes
- If you try to access /#dashboard without being logged you are redirect to /#login and vice-versa


**Tools used:**
- React, React Routes and Babel CDN links
- Task Runner : gulp
- css processor : SCSS
- Music Search API : musikki-api - https://music-api.musikki.com


**Next steps:**

I will use this project as base to learn more about React and other libraries that work with React like Flux/Redux and integrate it with Gulp.
